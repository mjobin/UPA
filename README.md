The Universal Pipeline Accessory is a Python tool for automating processing and population genetics analyses downstream of generating BAM files from NGS sequencing runs. It was developed in response to numerous tasks that the members of the UCSC Human Paleogenomics lab performed on a regular basis with a myriad of separate scripts and one-liners in bash, in an attempt to standardize and simplify work in population genetics. While the Human Paleogenomics lab largely works with ancient DNA, many of the functions are applicable to modern DNA data.
